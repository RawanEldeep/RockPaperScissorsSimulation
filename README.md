# RockPaperScissorsSimulation
# Overview
- This project simulates 10,000 rounds of rock-paper-scissors to test two strategies and see if any can beat random play.
---
# Strategies Tested
- Fixed Move: Player always chooses the same move (e.g., always Rock).

- Counter Player: Player adapts by playing the move that beats the opponent’s last move.
---
# Results
- Fixed Move win rates: ~32.4% to 33.5%.

- Counter Player overall win rate: ~32.7%.

- Counter Player’s conditional win rates varied slightly depending on the opponent’s last move, but no clear advantage emerged.
---
# Conclusion
- No strategy significantly outperformed random play since the opponent’s moves were random. Winning rates hovered around 33%, showing no decisive edge. Future work could test more complex adaptive strategies, especially against human players.
